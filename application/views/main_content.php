<h1><?php echo __('Welcome to Kobo Maps');?></h1>
<p>
	KoBoMap is the latest KoBo product and is currently in development. The idea of KoBoMap is to facilitate the 
	geospatial presentation of survey data. Survey data are typically available at national or sub-national levels. 
	Few organizations have the capability to produce maps, yet, the ability to represent geographically various indicators 
	can yield important information about the spatial distribution of events and population characteristics. Maps also 
	provide an easy way to share information without having to release raw data.

<p>
	KoBoMap is currently being developed using results from a survey conducted in 2010 among 4,501 adult Liberians 
	randomly selected throughout the country. Results can be seen here.
